Our biggest source of motivation was to ensure that the deficient points in our newly-employed colleagues are not also in the candidates in the project, and to help them a step into the profession with enthusiasm. Choosing the right sector/department before starting  the job, learning many issues that the student can learn in at least one year after starting the job, by hearing and seeing one-on-one from people who have spent years in this job and have had many experiences, will create very important opportunities in one’s career. Personally, I learned a lot of things on my own with great difficulty in the first period I started working. Now, getting guide with a mentor while still a student is a very great opportunity and chance. As mentors, also we could learn new things with this project."

Human contact, in all segments, has gained a significant importance. The same applies to mentoring. Unfortunately, young people have a limited access to other people's knowledge, experience, support – to everything that can significantly help them on their development path. And this is precisely the responsibility of those who can and should share this wealth selflessly. In this way both sides are ennobled. It is an opportunity for the mentor to pass on a part of his acquired experience and knowledge to new generations on which the world rests, thus indirectly influencing the creation of a better tomorrow."

This process could be a very challenging process with a lot of questions. Through the mentorship program the idea of sharing our experiences, and helping students to their next choices tempted me, and I participated in this program. The benefits of this project for students are that mentors share their knowledge and experience with students, see the strengths and weaknesses of students as an external eye and help them develop, increase their self-confidence. With these factors, the awareness of the students will increase, and they will make more proper choices. I believe in my heart this chance could even change their careers."

All of the students that participated in this project worked and spent time without any compulsive factors; with their personal awareness and goals. In my meetings, they were sometimes interrogatives, sometimes listening, and mostly they were enthusiastic to talk about what awaits them in the future .In my opinion, the most impressive side of the students was their solution- oriented sight.

			"Before the beginning of 2020, If you asked what a pandemic is, we would definitely search at Google. It was not the situation we have experienced before.",
			"Now, we know that this was an outbreak that make people stay at their homes, construct social distance with other people and enforce them to embrace New World Order. While New World Order was mentioned during Pandemic, we intended to build this new order together and we took the road with the notion “Guiding to Future”.",
			"While people are trying to fit their lives into their home, exploring themselves and the environment during the Pandemic, they are feeling worried about not finding self-satisfying answers to question which is “Where is our existence in this process ?”. Spending whole time at homes, people understood the importance of such notions as personal growth, social responsibility and awareness. The whole world turned into their inside and thought of what type of changes they would love to make in their lives. People realized that they forgot finding themselves in their daily lives and they felt the significance of gaining their life experiences again.",
			"Therefore, in this pursuit, in order to be an answer for people, by inspiring from the quote of Mahatma Gandhi “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.”, we created Let’s FutureUP project for young people who care about their development and want to say hello to their future careers."
