In my opinion, participating in a productive, initiative and communication- oriented project process is very important for our students. This process can help to understand the place of theoretical knowledge and perform them in the coming years. Moreover, students can learn from their mentors about solving problems, communication, critical thinking, making decisions, taking responsibilities and establishing networks with this Project.

Human contact, in all segments, has gained a significant importance. The same applies to mentoring. Unfortunately, young people have a limited access to other people's knowledge, experience, support – to everything that can significantly help them on their development path. And this is precisely the responsibility of those who can and should share this wealth selflessly. In this way both sides are ennobled. It is an opportunity for the mentor to pass on a part of his acquired experience and knowledge to new generations on which the world rests, thus indirectly influencing the creation of a better tomorrow."

			"Before the beginning of 2020, If you asked what pandemic is, we would definitely search at Google. It was not the situation we have experienced before.",
			"Now, we know that this was an outbreak that make people stay at their homes, construct social distance with other people and enforce them to embrace New World Order. While New World Order was mentioned during Pandemic, we intended to build this new order together and we took the road with the notion “Guiding to Future”.",
			"While people are trying to fit their lives into their homes, exploring themselves and the environment during the Pandemic, they are feeling worried about not finding self-satisfying answers to question which is “Where is our existence in this process ?”. Spending whole time at homes, people understood the importance of such notions as personal growth, social responsibility and awareness. The whole world turned into their inside and thought of what type of changes they would love to make in their lives. People realized that they forgot finding themselves in their daily lives and they felt the significance of gaining their life experiences again.",
			"Therefore, in this pursuit, in order to be an answer for people, by inspiring from the quote of Mahatma Gandhi “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.”, we created Let’s FutureUP project for young people who care about their development and want to say hello to their future career."

				"text": "Let's FutureUP Celebrates Its 1st Anniversary! We have left behind the first year of our project, which we started with great motivation and excitement as a team. The FutureUP team, which has been advancing with strength in the online platform with the bond of “volunteering” since the day it was founded, came together this time in Bursa Workinton. The team, which has accomplished great things together throughout the term, shared their ideas face to face this time and talked about their strategies for the next period. To Workinton Bursa, one of our sponsors who did not leave us alone on this special day; Thank you to Hacihasanogullari Baklava for being a part of this meaningful volunteer platform and supporting us! Stay tuned for the new term applications to touch the lives of more people in the new term and to be a part of our team. Love, Let's FutureUP",
